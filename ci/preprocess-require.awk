# Rewrite each `require <ext>` gate in an upstream vgi sqllogictest into an
# explicit signed INSTALL+LOAD, so the prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest`
# (which links none of these extensions) can run the suite. The vgi extension
# comes from the signed community channel; httpfs/json/parquet/spatial from the
# signed core channel. `require-env` and every other directive pass through
# untouched. See ci/README.md.
#
# With `-v http=1`, also inject a signed `INSTALL httpfs FROM core; LOAD httpfs;`
# before the first worker ATTACH (keyed off `require vgi` or `require-env
# VGI_TEST_WORKER`). The prebuilt `haybarn-unittest` does not statically link
# httpfs, so `ATTACH ... (TYPE vgi, LOCATION 'http://...')` fails with a binder
# error unless httpfs is loaded into the connection first.
